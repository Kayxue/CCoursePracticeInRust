# 第四次作業第一題
## 題目
Write a program to do addition of matrices, i.e. C = A + B, where C, A, and B are matrices.

Do the following things in your main().
Declare three integer arrays with 20 × 20 elements as C, A, and B.
Ask the user about the dimensions of these matrices. (NOTE: their dimensions are the same.)
Get numbers in matrices A and B.
Print out values in matrix C.
## 範例
```
Both A and B are matrices with m x n elements.

How many sets of test data: 2

Input values of m and n: 2 3
Input numbers in matrix A: 2 7 4 2 8 6
Input numbers in matrix B: 8 5 2 6 8 0
Numbers in matrix C are:
{{10, 12, 6},
{8, 16, 6}}

Input values of m and n: 4 2
Input numbers in matrix A: 2 1 8 6 87 -3 32 -6
Input numbers in matrix B: 28 43 4 65 -7 23 0 11
Numbers in matrix C are:
{{30, 44},
{12, 71},
{80, 20},
{32, 5}}
```
