# 第二次作業第一題
## 題目
A sequence like 1, 4, 7, 10, ... is an arithmetic sequence (等差數列) with a common difference (公差) of 3.  
Ask the user to input the first number (首項), the upper limit (末項最大可能值), and the common difference (公差).  
Output the sum of the given sequence.  
Repeat several times.  
## 範例
```
How many sets of test data: 3

The first number: 1
The upper limit: 20
Common difference: 3
The sum of this arithmetic sequence is 70.

The first number: 77
The upper limit: 87
Common difference: 5
The sum of this arithmetic sequence is 246.

The first number: 5
The upper limit: 100
Common difference: 26
The sum of this arithmetic sequence is 176.
